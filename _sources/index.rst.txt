This is "Irrelevant!"
*********************

This is an excerpt from a project on my intern at Shopee. This is a simple approach to help
eliminate wrongly categorized product within the platform by using the term frequency. A previous approach
using SVM has been tried but was not pursued further because of difficulty in rule extraction.

To generate the html documentation, run the ``compile.sh`` script (after installing the ``requirements.txt``).
To test, just run ``python irrelevant/irrelevant.py -v``.
